                        <p class="text-left">Hello! It's May, what a beautiful time of the year - in spite of the lack of Sporadic E openings.<br>
                        During this month, many amazing things have happened, which will help the FMDX community progress forward. Let's get through them!</p>

                        <h3 class="color-main">FMLIST Discussion</h3>
                        <p class="text-left">
                        Over the last few days, some of you might have noticed, that many members directly related to <span class="color-main">FMLIST</span> have joined our Discord community server, we welcome them here! 
                        With them joining, this was historically the first time where we, as a community, could have direct discussion with the project maintainers - thanks to this, they received tons of feedback, which I hope will make them improve their project and that the concerns of DXers will be addressed.</p> 
                        
                        <p class="text-left">I would like to thank everyone for keeping the discussion civil & polite. 
                        After this conversation, two new channels have been created - <span class="color-gray">#fmlist</span> and <span class="color-gray">#fmscan</span>.<br>In these channels, FMLIST members will actively listen to your feedback & suggestions - I believe this will help everyone in the community. </p>

                        <h3 class="color-main">Website news</h3>
                        <p class="text-left">We have ordered a domain and we are working on the entire server / hosting structure at this time. At the time of writing the original newsletter, this website wasn't available, but here we are. You're reading this, that's amazing!</p>

                        <h3 class="color-main">Project news</h3>
                        <h4 class="text-left">OpenRadio collaborative projects</h4>
                        <p class="text-left">‚Ä¢ Active development on our Headless TEF Receiver (a TEF receiver with a built-in sound card & antenna switch) is progressing further.
