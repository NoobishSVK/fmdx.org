                        <h3 class="color-main">Headless TEF Lite</h3>
                        <p class="text-left">Headless TEF lite is a stripped-down version of the original Headless TEF tuner. It includes only the core components needed for reliable performance.<br>
                        There‚Äôs a single combined AM/FM antenna input, and no support for expansion modules (hats).<br>
                        The input filtering is a bit simpler than in the full version, but still more than good enough for most use cases.</p>

                        <p class="text-left">Because it's cheaper to produce, the Headless TEF lite lets us offer an affordable option for people who want to get started with setting up their own radio servers.<br>
                        It‚Äôs a practical choice for anyone who doesn‚Äôt need all the extras and just wants something that works.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">One notable thing is that this is the smallest TEF ever released, at only <strong>55 x 25 mm</strong> (2.16 x 0.99 in) - this is even smaller than RTL-SDR for example!</p>

                        <p class="text-left">The first few units will be available on our Discord's marketplace for you to buy. The expected sale price is around 50‚Ç¨ + shipping from EU, however this may vary by seller.<br>
                        These devices are also much easier to build.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">There are currently no 3D enclosures. If you design one, we might reward you! However, we will make a separate announcement for this.</p>
