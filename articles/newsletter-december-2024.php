                        <p class="text-left">It's here, we made it through 2024. So, what did we manage to do in 2024?</p>

                        <h3 class="color-main">Our achievements</h3>
                        <h4 class="color-main">FM-DX Webserver</h4>
                        <p class="text-left">2024 has been a groundbreaking year for FM DXing and the community as a whole. It also marked the debut of one of our most ambitious projects: the webserver.
                            What began as a simple interface to display the current frequency, RDS info, and signal data has evolved into something extraordinary.
                            Today, we boast hundreds of webservers across the globe, enhanced by plugins developed and managed by our dedicated community members. This incredible achievement wouldn’t have been possible without your support.</p>

                        <h4 class="color-main">FMDX.org Website</h4>
                        <p class="text-left">Another milestone this year was the launch of the official FMDX.org website. Designed to keep you informed about the latest DXing news and projects, it has since merged with fmdx.pl and maps.fmdx.pl to form the ultimate platform for DXing enthusiasts.
                                This unified platform aims to streamline access to tools, resources, and updates, making it easier than ever to stay informed and up-to-date with all the happenings in the community!
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="color-main">Headless TEF & TEF Firmware</h4>
                        <p class="text-left">The headless TEF receiver, featuring the powerful TEF6687 chip and multiple antenna inputs, has also made waves in 2024.
                            Many DXers have adopted this advanced hardware designed by Konrad Kosmatka & Sjef Verhoeven, enabling them to catch distant signals with remarkable clarity and reduced interference.
                            It’s worth noting that the ESP32 TEF firmware has reached version 2, a significant milestone in its development. Sjef, one of our founders and most important contributors, continues to work tirelessly on bug fixes and new features as we speak.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="color-main">VHF DX Podcast</h4>
                        <p class="text-left">In addition to these advancements, 2024 saw two episodes of the VHF DX Podcast, managed primarily by American DX enthusiasts,
                            which featured community members Noobish and Sjef discussing our projects and ideas for the future. These episodes provided valuable insights and stories from the world of DXing,
                            helping to strengthen connections within the global DXing community.</p>

                        <h3 class="color-main">Financial recap</h3>
                        <p class="text-left">On the financial front, we raised a total of <strong>€463</strong> this year after transaction fees. While these funds remain unused, we plan to invest them wisely in 2025 to ensure our community keeps evolving.
                            Transparency remains a core value for us, and we’ll continue to keep you updated on how these funds are utilized!</p>

                        <p class="text-left">As we step into 2025, we’re excited to build on the progress we’ve made and explore new opportunities. Thank you for being an integral part of this journey. Here’s to another year of innovation and collaboration in the world of FM DXing!</p>

                        <h3 class="color-main">Christmas giveaway winners</h3>
                        <p class="text-left">As many of you already know, we hosted a giveaway of multiple supporter tags for our Discord members, along with 3 winners of the TEFs.<br>
                            This giveaway consisted of 2 parts. The first part was random, and all you needed was a bit of luck. The second part was much more difficult.<br>
                            The task was simple, yet very interesting – simply post your favourite DX spot, ideally with a nice description and some pictures. We had the opportunity to choose 2 winners.</p>
                            
                        <p class="text-left">We chose the winners based on (but not limited to) the following criteria: post description quality, picture quality, and how interesting the spot itself was.<br><br>
                        Choosing only two people was very difficult, so every moderator and founder decided to post their top 3 based on the criteria. The 2 people with the most votes were the ones we ended up choosing.
                        We only voted based on the post itself, so previous activity (positive or negative) wasn't counted in any way. Since there were more people with amazing entries, we decided to give out extra supporter tags.</p>

                        <p class="text-bold">To claim your prize, message Noobish on Discord by January 15th, 2025, under the Discord account you won with.</p>

                        <h3 class="color-main">Winners!</h3>
