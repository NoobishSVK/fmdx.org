                        <p class="text-left">With the start of the Sporadic E season in Europe, it's time to take a look at the news we've brought you over the last two months.</p>

                        <h3 class="color-main">Achievements</h3>
                        <p class="text-left">We've reached several amazing milestones - one of the biggest being <strong>2000 members</strong> on our Discord server! That’s far more than we ever expected. We started as a small community sharing firmware updates, and now we’re here- and you’re a part of it, which is amazing!<br>
                        To celebrate, we will launch a giveaway in July with interesting prices!<br>
                        In addition to that, we’ve surpassed <strong>300 public webservers</strong>, and our community plugin maintainers have added over <strong>6,000 logos from 72 countries</strong> to the Logos Plugin. We’re very thankful for every single contributor.</p>
                        
                        <p class="text-left">When it comes to FMLIST, we broke the record barrier. The previous record stood at approximately <strong>14600 logs in a single day</strong>, the latest record is over <strong>23000 logs</strong>, which is a huge upgrade, with a considerable amoutn of logs coming from the FM-DX Webserver interface directly. Big congratulations to FMLIST!</p>
