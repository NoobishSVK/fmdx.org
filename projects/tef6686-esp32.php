                        <p class="text-left">The ESP32 TEF6686 tuner, developed by <a href="/founders.php" class="text-bold color-main">Sjef Verhoeven (PE5PVB)</a>, is a DIY project featuring a comprehensive DSP AM/FM receiver with a TFT color screen. This project uses the ESP32 microcontroller and a high-quality TEF6686 chip.
                        It also serves as the foundation for many Chinese pre-built tuners, which utilize the same software.</p>

                        <p class="text-left">The default view mode on the TFT screen shows the frequency, signal strength, and RDS information. Additionally, it can display frequency deviation and the current reception bandwidth.<p>
                        <p class="text-left">When it comes to FM, the tuner supports both the OIRT and CCIR bands (65-108 MHz). It also receives AM bands, including longwave, medium-wave, and shortwave broadcasting (144 kHz-27 MHz).</p>

                        <p class="text-left">Later on, Chinese hardware manufacturers have decided to use this open-source project to build their own tuners, which are now sold worldwide. The firmware is actively being developed by the FMDX community to this day.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The current firmware version is <span class="color-main text-bold">v2.11</span>, with betas available on our Discord community server.</p>
